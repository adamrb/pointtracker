pointtracker
============

## Notice
This was created as a personal alternative to a popular weight loss website.  It is not meant for commercial use, and was largely used as a learning exercise for PHP.

## Info
This is a calorie tracking web software built on PHP/MySQL.

It's modeled similar to a popular commercial calorie tracking website that uses as system based on points.

Create an account, provide basic information, and it will give you a daily and weekly points allowance. Enter and track your daily food consumption.

Includes integration with Calorieking for Nutrition information lookup, Twitter, and the Withings Wifi enabled body scale.
